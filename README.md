This project aims to link string mentions in table cells to multiple linked knowledge bases. Here, we publish the benchmark of the sampled Web tables, where each string mention is linked to the entities in Zhishi.me, the largest Chinese LOD consisting of three Chinese linked KBs: Chinese Wikipedia, Baidu Baike and Hudong Baike.
